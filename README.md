## Description

In this challenge I worked with JS to create a code which detects a specific combination of key presses and launches an action on corrects keys press. The resulting page displays unicorn pictures on password entry.

Working on this project helped me in better understanding of:

<li>Event listeners</li>
<li>Array methods such as push, trim, includes, splice and join</li><br>

## Usage
